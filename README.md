# <h3>How it works</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Time Booked: </b>The tool automatically calculates the proportion of time in the week that was booked out (relative to the amount of time you're contracted to work - check out the settings cog wheel to change the default!)</li>
<li><b>Project Time: </b> Use your Outlook Categories to define project and non-project work, allowing the software to breakdown your time into dedicated project delivery and routine maintainence tasks.</li>
<li><b>Meeting Time: </b> Ever feel like you're spending most of your time in meetings, unable to actually do the things you're committing to, because of <i>aaaallllll</i> the meetings you're committed to? See the proportion of time spent in meetings!</li>
</ul>
