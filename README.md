# <h3>How it works</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Time Booked: </b>The tool automatically calculates the proportion of time in the week that was booked out (relative to the amount of time you're contracted to work - check out the settings cog wheel to change the default!)</li>
<li><b>Project Time: </b> Use your Outlook Categories to define project and non-project work, allowing the software to breakdown your time into dedicated project delivery and routine maintainence tasks.</li>
<li><b>Meeting Time: </b> Ever feel like you're spending most of your time in meetings, unable to actually do the things you're committing to, because of <i>aaaallllll</i> the meetings you're committed to? See the proportion of time spent in meetings!</li>
</ul>

# <h3>Data</h3>
<ul><li>The tool does not store any data at all. The tool displays summary statistics to the screen when it is in use and no data is retained once the application is closed.</li>
<li>The tool does not interact with any network entities or databases. The only file the tool interacts with is the CSV file identified by the user through the drag-and-drop process or file-load icon.</li>
<li>The only persistent data in this process is the CSV file generated by Outlook. This is the userâ€™s responsibly and can be removed directly after analysis.</li>
<li>The tool allows the user to save the an image file, but the location of that image file is also determined by the user.</li>
